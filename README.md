# Multiplex Reconstruction via Graph Embeddings

[Project Description]

## Getting Started

The code base for this project is written in Python with package management handled with Conda.

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development, testing, and analysis purposes.

### Prerequisites

A compatible Python install is needed to begin - the package management is handled by Conda as described below.
- [Python \[3.10+\]](https://python.org/downloads/)
- [Conda \[ 4.14+\]](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/download.html)

### Installing

To (locally) reproduce this project, do the following:

0. Download this code base. Notice that raw data are typically not included in the git-history and may need to be downloaded independently.
1. Open a terminal with Python and Conda installed and run the commands:
   ```
   $> conda env create -f environment.yaml
   $> conda activate EmbeddedNaive
   ```

This will install all necessary packages for you to be able to run the scripts and everything should work out of the box.
