N:
  _name: "size, number of nodes"
  description: "Number of nodes of the multiplex network. Attribute only found on synthetic benchmarks where size is controlled in multiplex generation."
  notes: [
    "Listed value is the number of nodes in _one_ layer of the multiplex - the benchmark generation procedure assumes similar layers, hence, the total number of nodes if the layers are maximally disjoint is 2*N"
