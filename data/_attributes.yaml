N:
  _name: "size, number of nodes"
  description: "Number of nodes of the multiplex network. Attribute only found on synthetic benchmarks where size is controlled in multiplex generation."
  notes: [
    "Listed value is the number of nodes in _one_ layer of the multiplex - the benchmark generation procedure assumes similar layers, hence, the total number of nodes if the layers are maximally disjoint is 2*N"
  ]
mu:
  _name: "community strength, mixing paramater"
  description: "Mixing parameter in LFR model; proxies community strength and planted partition modularity values."
  notes:
t1:
  _name: "gamma, degree heterogeneity, degree distribution paramater"
  description:  "Exponent of degree distribution Power-law distribution. Controls the heterogeneity of the degree sequence."
  notes:
t2:
  _name: "community heterogeneity, community size distribution parameter"
  description: "Exponent of degree distribution Power-law distribution. Controls the heterogeneity of the degree sequence."
  notes:
kavg:
  _name: "average degree"
  description: "Average degree of sampled degree sequence."
  notes:
kmin:
  _name: "minimum degree"
  description: "Minimum degree of sampled degree sequence."
  notes:
kmax:
  _name: "maximum degree, degree cutoff"
  description: "Maximum degree, enforced degree cutoff for power-law sampled degree sequence."
  notes:
prob:
  _name: "probability, relabeling probability, shuffling, correlation"
  description: "Node relabeling probability, controls the correlated of degree sequences between layers."
  notes:
sign:
  _name: "sign, shuffling direction"
  description: "Enforced correlation of layer degree sequences after shuffling."
  notes:
name:
  _name: "system, system name"
  description: "Name of the system being analyzed. Useful for real-world multiplexes."
  notes:
layers:
  _name: "layers, induced duplex, sub-multiplex"
  description: "Labels of layers used in duplex analysis when several layers are present. If a synthetic network, default to 1 and 2."
