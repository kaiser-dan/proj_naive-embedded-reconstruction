# Experimental Protocol Index

Embedding-based Multiplex Reconstruction experiment index.

This document maintains indexing data for experiments asociated to this project. Short summaries of the projects are given here, however, full details on each experiment are available in the associated protocols. These protocols are prefaced with `protocol_` and in the same relative directory as this index.

# Operative Experiments

Experiments are considered "operative" if they are actively being developed or ran, being designed, or completed without problems.

## Active

Active experiments are settings currently being developed or analyzed.

- ex32
  - Associated experiments: ex31, ex32
  - Summary: Full factorial experiment on logistic regression features with configuration embedded distance form and adjusted renormalization procedure on synthetic networks.

## Completed

Completed experiments are settings with generated, analyzed results that are without question.

## Planned

Planned experiments are experiments that are planned or actively being designed, but before active development starts.



# Inoperative Experiments

Experiments are considered "inoperative" if their results should be considered flawed/incorrect.

## Failed Experiments

Failed experiments are experimental setups that are bugged or incomplete. They cannot be reproduced as is.

- ex04
- ex05
- ex06
- ex07

## Depreciated experiments

Depreciated experiments may, unlike failed experiments, be reproduced as is but the methodolofgies and theories behind their implementation may be unreasonable or nonsensical.
