# >> General information >>
# This configuration file controls the behavior of the corresponding experiment workflow.
# One of the few "hard" constraints on the workflow is that this file is located
# in the same location as 'Snakefile' and 'scripts/'
# << General information <<

# >> Configuration >>
# Broadly, we split the configurable parameters of this workflow into 4 categories:
# 0) meta
# 1) network
# 2) experiment
# 3) workflow

# (0) meta
# These parameters control identifiers for resultant data.
# It is highly recommend you interface some external auto-increment tool,
# else this does not act as suitable "version control".

# (1) network
# Specify which networks should be ran as well as what layers.
# All alpha layers are paired with all beta layers.
# Generally, it is recommended you use alpha < beta - the MRP is inherently
# symmetric and reconstructing (alpha, beta) is the same as (beta, alpha).

# SOMETHING ABOUT ALPHA = BETA

# (2) experiment
# Here we add the "main" parameters in the experiment. These are properties of the procedure
# or tools used.
# Generally, "params" are parameters of research interest and will be sweeped over.
# "hyperparams" usually denote parameters that could have a non-negligible effect on results,
# however, there may not be a need/desire/intuition on their optimal values.

# (3) workflow
# These parameters are exclusively configurations on Snakemake and generated files.
# Changing them mostly comes down to researcher preference on file names.
# << Configuration <<

# >> Non-configurable >>
# The import of this file into the Snakemake workflow has to be hardcoded*.
# Do not rename this file or move anything.
# << Non-configurable <<
